# AtpDataElixir

Hosted here, on Heroku:
https://tennis-earnings.herokuapp.com/

This project shows the discrepancy between earnings in the ATP tennis
circuit.  We gather data from the <a target="_blank"
href="http://www.atpworldtour.com/en/rankings/singles"> list of currently
ranked singles players</a> in the ATP (for the current season) and
display the most recent amount for each of the players on the list.

This app is written in Elixir, uses Phoenix to handle web requests,
Postgres to persist the data and Chart.js to create the charts.  <a
